This is the personal website/blog of Maxiwell Luo, though right now it's housing some of my random thoughts. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/maxluoXIII) to see my projects. Check out my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxXIII13) for my shorter random thoughts.

As for who I am, I'm a recent graduate from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I was in the 5-year BS/MCS program for Computer Science, but I completed it in 4 years because I was fortunate enough to enter the university with enough credits to shorten my undergraduate studies. I'll be taking a break before starting full-time at IBM, where I'll be working on IBM i. My hobbies include anime, video games, and basketball. I'd like to learn about photography and spend more time working on programming projects (including this site!). I hope you'll join me in this crazy journey we call life!
